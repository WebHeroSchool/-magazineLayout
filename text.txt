Fantastic. From Germany's famed Bavarian Motor Works, a full-sized, four-passenger sports coupe that will corner with a Ferrari, accelerate with a Porsche, give you the de- pendability of a Mercedes and the work- manship of a Rolls-Royce. 

You can drive it all day at speeds over 115 m.p.h. and not strain it in the slightest. You can drive it for hours on end and not feel fatigued. You can drive it over the roughest of country roads even at high speeds with the utmost security, thanks to its unique suspension system. 

It has the most advanced four- cylinder engine ever designed, and it may be ordered with the renowned ZF Automatic Transmission. Inside and out, it is finished to the highest standards of elegance. Many of the world's automotive experts believe that no other car offers this combination of qualities. You have to drive the BMW Coupe to believe it. But we warn you: once you do, you may never be satisfied with anything less, even if it costs more.
